/*
 * Clip-on snow plow attachment designed for Brio/Thomas style wooden trains.
 *
 * This vertical-print version is designed to look more like the plow on the
 * "Adventures of Thomas" train than the original pattern (thing:54071).  It
 * also has a tilted-up bottom edge of the blade to hopefully prevent it from
 * getting stuck when the toy train goes down a slope.
 *
 * Because this version can snag at the bottom of a steep slope, I also have
 * a vertical-printing version designed to allow for a tilted bottom
 * edge that is less likely to have issues.  You can find it here:
 *
 *   http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:87677
 *
 * I also highly encourage you to use the mounting magnet cavity.  Just insert
 * the magnet (after double-checking polarity) and glue it into place with
 * epoxy or by manually extruding epoxy into the hole.
 * 
 * Mounting-magnet dimensions are based on:
